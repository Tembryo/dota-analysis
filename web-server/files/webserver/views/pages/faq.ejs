                <h2>What does Wisdota do?</h2>
                 <p class="lead"> 
                    Wisdota lets you track your performance in your Dota matches by automatically downloading and analysing your replay files every time you play. It estimates the MMR level you played at, along with scores for your last hitting, fights and displays this data in the dashboard on your user page. </p>

                <br>
                <h2  >Why would I want to rate my performance?</h2>
                  <p class="lead"> 
                    Tracking your performance over time lets you see trends and helps you identify areas in which you can improve. "If you can't measure it, you can't improve it" - Lord Kelvin.

                <br>
                <h2>How accurate is the rating?</h2>
                  <p class="lead"> 
                    At the moment the analysis is in a very early state, so the results should definitely be taken with a grain of salt. Stay tuned for the coming changes!
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>How does Wisdota work?</h2>
                  <p class="lead"> 
                    Your replay files contain a wealth of information on how you play Dota. By training a model on a large number of replays we have identified features of players at the different skill levels (1000-8000+ MMR). Using this model we can map the features in your replay files to an MMR rating along with a rating for your last hitting, fights and more.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Is it free?</h2>
                  <p class="lead"> 
                    The basic level features are all available for free, whilst some of the more advanced features are available on a monthly subscription. See the <a href="/plus">subscription page</a> for further details. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Can I download my replay files?</h2>
                  <p class="lead"> 
                    Yes, plus users can download their replay files from us whenever they like. We automatically store all of their replay files for the past 6 months.
